This program takes advantage of the bmp085 pressure/temperature sensor to report either the altitude, or atmospheric pressure normalized to sea level along a with a graph of the past pressure.  Altitude will not be accurate if the weather is changing and weather will not be accurate if you change your altitude.

The required sensor is available in the freerunner navigation board, or can be installed separately (see http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/I2C_Pressure_Sensor or http://jeepingben.homelinux.net/index.php?level=album&id=24). A kernel module is required to access the bmp085.  It is available in 2.6.36 or by compiling it separately.  The module source is at: http://gitorious.org/freerunner-navigation-board/bmp085
